Instrumental
============

Instrumental is a Python-based library of support code used by the Mabuchi Lab
at Stanford University. It is currently still under heavy development, so its
interfaces are subject to change.

Instrumental makes heavy use of NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, as well as Pint, a Python units library, and PyVISA/VISA, and other drivers for interfacing with lab devices.
